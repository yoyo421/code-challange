# Code Review Project Overview

This project provides a foundation for handling API requests, focusing on asynchronous programming and processing large datasets. It includes two core APIs:

1. **Slow Search API**: A country name search API with an intentionally introduced delay, designed for optimizing search response time.
2. **Big Data API**: Supplies 4MB of dataset to test efficiency in processing and visualizing large data.

### Project Directory Summary

- **server/routes/**: Contains API route implementations.
  - `slow-search.mjs`: Handles the country name search.
  - `big-data.mjs`: Provides large dataset for analysis.
  - `health.mjs`: Health check endpoint.
  - `index.mjs`: Loads all server routes.
- **server/index.mjs**: Main server entry point.
- **server/dockerfile**: Sets up Docker container for the server.
- **server/package.json**: Lists dependencies and scripts.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yoyo421/code-challange.git
   cd code-review
   ```
2. **Build and launch with Docker Compose**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Access the APIs**
   - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8081/api-docs`
   - Health Check: `http://localhost:8081/health`

## Assignments

Create an application with 2 pages, each page for each api assigment.

### Slow Search API (Country Search Optimization)

1. **User Interface (UI) Search Bar**: Develop a user interface with a search bar where users can search for country names.
2. **Throttling Mechanism**: Implement request throttling to limit API calls while typing, reducing server load.
3. **Request Cancellation**: Ensure only the latest search query is processed, discarding outdated requests.
4. **Display Results**: Display the search results clearly and in an organized list.

### Big Data API (Character Frequency Analysis)

1. **Graph Generation**: Visualize data from the big data API to analyze character frequency.
   - **Bar Chart**: Show frequency of the most common character in each 1000-character chunk.
   - **Line Chart**: Plot the trend of the most frequent character's occurrence across chunks.
   - **Pie Chart**: Display distribution of the most frequent characters across all chunks.
   - Use Chart.js, D3.js, or any other library to create these graphs.
2. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: Calculate the standard deviation for character frequencies to measure variability across the dataset.

### Bonus Points

- **UI Styling**: Design a clean, intuitive user interface for the search feature and results.
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to validate functionality of both the search and data processing.
- **Documentation**: Include a detailed README or technical notes describing your approach, challenges, and how you addressed them.

## Notes

- The search API has a 1-second delay to simulate slow network conditions. Optimizing this interaction is key.
- The server code must not be modified; the focus is on optimizing the client-side implementation and data visualization.
- The server runs on port `8081` (mapped internally from `8080` in Docker).

Feel free to explore the project and showcase your creativity in implementation. The goal is to demonstrate your proficiency in building responsive, optimized solutions for both search and large dataset analysis.
